NHDDL is a Neutrino launcher that scans MMCE, APA or FAT/exFAT-formatted BDM devices for ISO files, lists them and boots selected ISO via Neutrino.

It displays visual Game ID to trigger per-title settings on the Pixel FX line of products and triggers per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO2.

Note that this not an attempt at making a Neutrino-based Open PS2 Loader replacement.
Since NHDDL only launches Neutrino, PADEMU, IGR, IGS, cheats and other features supported by OPL are out-of-scope unless they are implemented in Neutrino.
