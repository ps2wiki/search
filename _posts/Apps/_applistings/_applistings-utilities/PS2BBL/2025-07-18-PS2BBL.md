A flexible BootLoader for PlayStation 2™ and PSX-DESR capable of properly initializing the system, loading discs (PS1, PS2, DVD-Video) and running software from several storage devices. 

This program is based on a set of osd initialization samples written by sp193 himself, creator of the FreeMcBoot 1.9 series. So PS2BBL is capable of doing it's job as well as FreeMcBoot does.
