PS2Link is a 'bootloader' which, used together with an Ethernet driver and a TCP/IP stack, enables you to download and execute software on your PS2.

It is designed to run from memory card, cdrom or host drives.

It loads all IRX's at startup and IPCONFIG.DAT for the network settings. The IRX's and the IPCONFIG.DAT should be in the directory which PS2LINK is loaded from.
