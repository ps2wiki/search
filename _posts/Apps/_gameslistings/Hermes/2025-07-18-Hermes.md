Our hero, known to his friends as Hermes, lives in France, the country of love which is also known for its exquisite cuisine. One day Hermes had an appetite for grilled chicken. Certainly a man's man like Hermes, wouldn't go to the supermarket for frozen chicken. No! He's going to slaughter his own farm-raised free range chicken, but this chicken has a mind of his own. This is where our story starts...

Chase the escaped chicken to catch it and prepare yourself an unforgettable barbecue-grilled chicken.

Yummy! But hell, that chicken sure runs fast!
