Enceladus is a project that seeks to facilitate and at the same time brings a complete kit for users to create homebrew software for PlayStation 2 using the Lua language. It has dozens of built-in functions, both for creating games and apps. The main advantage over using Enceladus project instead of the pure PS2SDK is above all the practicality, you will use one of the simplest possible languages to create what you have in mind, besides not having to compile, just script and test, fast and simple.
