Kernelloader is a bootloader for PS2 Linux and other PS2 operating systems.  
The current state is:  
- Linux can be started. Graphic, USB, network, hard disc, game controllers and memory cards are working. CDVD can read PS1 CDs, PS2 DVDs and video DVDs.
- USB write access on slim PSTwo is unstable. It is recommended to use the Linux Live DVD instead of a USB memory device.

You can put all files on a USB memory stick and load "kloader.elf" with Action Replay Media Player or FMCB (Free Memory Card Boot).  
Then you select the kernel "vmlinux" from the USB stick.  
You can also select the initrd "initrd.gz" from the USB stick.
