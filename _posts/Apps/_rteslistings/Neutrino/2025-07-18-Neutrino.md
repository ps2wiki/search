A neutrino is a particle with almost zero mass, and that's what this device emulator's primary goal is. To have almost 0 mass when emulating devices to maximize compatibility.

Neutrino also does not have a user interface, instead it's meant to be integrated as a backend to a frontend (user interface). Possible user interfaces can be uLaunchELF, XEB+, OPL or any new user interface. This makes neutrino much more easy to maintain, and allows many more applications to be made using neutrino as the backend.

With neutrino all modules are... modular. They are in a separate folder called modules. This allows the user add new and improved modules. What modules are loaded is fully configurable using TOML config files in the config folder.
