POPStarter is a homebrew application for the PS2 that allows users to run PS1 games directly from the PS2’s USB, HDD or network device. It's essentially a tool that lets you bypass the PS2's limitation of not being able to play PS1 games via connected media like USB or HDD with added features and patches like widescreen support which is not natively supported by the PS2.
